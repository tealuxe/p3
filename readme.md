# Project 2

## Outside resources
*I used the [Skeleton CSS framework](http://getskeleton.com/), a lightweight alternative to Bootstrap. I began with the default template and adjusted the margins and background color in an external CSS document. I consulted [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) for various CSS tips, including text alignment, font weight, and colors. For the body surface formula idea, I consulted and reviewed these two generic BSA calculator websites: [https://www.calculator.net/body-surface-area-calculator.html](https://www.calculator.net/body-surface-area-calculator.html) and [http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bsa-calculator/](http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bsa-calculator/). I also consulted stackoverflow(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6535362/gitignore-after-commit) to deal with a problem I had removing the .idea directory from the git repo. I consulted tutsplus (https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-register-use-laravel-service-providers--cms-28966) to understand Laravel services after considering the best way to remove logic code from controller, and I used their example as a starting point. I also consulted StackOverflow(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38461677/what-is-the-best-practice-to-show-old-value-when-editing-a-form-in-laravel) for the best way to combine the old function (in the case of errors) with other data returned from a normal session.*

## Notes for instructor
*As mentioned, I consulted an external site for recommendations on how to separate logic code from the controller into a Laravel service. It seemed that there were a number of ways to separate such code, but this seemed to be a recommended way according to Laravel best practices, even though it was slightly confusing.*
